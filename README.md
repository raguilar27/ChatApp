# ChatApp
The Chat App is a real-time chat application that enables the user to sign in with their credentials, via Google or Facebook.

It uses a Microservice architecture design that allows users to create chats, view past messages, and message other people with the help of ChatEngine.io.

The user is able to sign in, via Google or Facebook, by using Firebase's authentication system.

Once the user is signed in, the data is stored, then sent to ChatEngine.io using react-router-dom.

Developed the front end and functionality with React.js.
